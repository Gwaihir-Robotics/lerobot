# Mini Mapper - Autonomous Mapping Robot

A lidar-enabled differential drive robot for autonomous mapping and navigation using ROS2.

## Goal
Our robot should be able to map and navigate to rooms in a building and return to the starting point when mapping is completed. 

I want to be able to view the maps on the laptop and/or the additional control desktop. I would like to view the maps in rviz2/rerun.io as they are generated. We should leverage as much FOSS packages for the slam/lidar/mapping as possible such as nav2.org.

## Design
- **Differential Drive Robot**: 2x independent Feetech STS3215 servos with position-based control, trailing castor
- **Battery Powered**: 12V power supply via USB-C PD trigger cable
- **Computing Platform**: ROS2 (Kilted) on Raspberry Pi 4B running Ubuntu 24.04 LTS
- **Sensors**: Slamtech C1 lidar for SLAM and obstacle detection
- **Communication**: Remote operation via ROS2 over network (Tailscale)

## Hardware Specifications

### Servos: Feetech STS3215
- **Control Method**: Position-based differential drive (continuous rotation simulated)
- **Power Requirements**: 12V (minimum 6V)
- **Communication**: Half-duplex TTL serial via MotorBus adapter
- **IDs**: Left wheel = 7, Right wheel = 8

### Physical Parameters
- **Physical Dimensions**: 
    - Length 0.248m (~9.75 inches)
    - Width 0.248m (~9.75 inches)
    - Height: 0.130m (~5 inches)
- **Wheel Radius**: 0.05m (50mm wheels)
- **Max Linear Speed**: 0.5 m/s
- **Max Angular Speed**: 2.0 rad/s

## Quick Start

### 1. Hardware Setup
- tbd

## Next Development Steps

1. **Lidar Integration**: Set up Slamtech C1 lidar driver
2. **SLAM Configuration**: Configure slam_toolbox for mapping
3. **Navigation Setup**: Integrate nav2 for autonomous navigation  
4. **Visualization**: Set up RViz2 for real-time map viewing
5. **Testing**: Full autonomous mapping validation

## Bigger Picture
Developing autonomous ground-based robotics that leverage SLAM/lidar. This is a baseline ROS2 configuration proof of concept that can scale to larger systems (larger servos, larger bodies, more battery, more compute etc.).
